# Vue 3 + Vite + Docker base setup

Quickly install this by running
```bash
git clone https://github.com/moon250/vue-vite-docker.git
```

Then edit ``package.json``, ``docker-compose.yml`` to replace with your project name, then run

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

And everything is setup ! You can access your app at localhost on port 3000 (edit this in ``docker-compose.yml`` file)
